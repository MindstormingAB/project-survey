# Survey in React

The purpose of this week was to create a survey form using what we learned about form fields with React, how to use {useState} and how to show different components based on survey inputs.

## The problem

I created a survey with 3 questions using different form fields: select dropdown, radio buttons and text area.
The first question is displayed when the Start button is clicked.
The following questions are displayed when the previous one is answered.
When the last question is answered, the button Submit is revealed.
By clicking on Submit, a summary is displayed instead of the survey form.

The survey form is responsive and works in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari) and with ChromeVox Classic Extension.

I created a background made of an image and a gradient.
I customized the form fields.

If I had more time, I would add a footer, a fourth question with check boxes and proper validation.
I would even fix the scrollIntoView issue and create a multi-step form.

## View it live
